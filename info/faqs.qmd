__Will STAT 133 be offered in hybrid mode (both in-person and remotely, simultaneously)?__ <br>
No, STAT 133 will not be offered in hybrid mode. Instead, all classes and sections are to be delivered in-person. If you have time conflicts with lecture and/or section, please don't take STAT 133 this semester.

<br>

__Will there be live webcast or recordings of lectures?__ <br>
No. The class is designed assuming that you'll be present in both lecture and discussion.

<br>

__What can I do if I have to miss class?__ <br>
Missing a class should be a truly exceptional occurrence---reserved for emergencies or significant personal illness---rather than a recurring habit. On a side note, here's one fun fact from the students' course evaluations. The most common answer provided by the students when asked "What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?" is: __"Go to all the lectures and labs and start working on assignments early."__

I understand that your lives are incredibly full and that you are often navigating a heavy load of assignments, exams, job interviews, and various personal and extracurricular commitments. While it can be tempting to deprioritize this class when other deadlines feel more urgent, please remember that STAT 133 is a cumulative course where each session builds directly upon the previous one. Losing focus, even temporarily, can create significant gaps in your understanding that are difficult to bridge later in the semester.

Your presence not only keeps you in sync with our cumulative material but also enriches the experience for your peers, as your unique questions and insights often spark the most meaningful "lightbulb moments" for everyone in the room. My goal is for you to not only succeed but to master these analytical tools for your future careers. To achieve this, I ask that you treat our class time and coursework as a non-negotiable priority in your schedule. If you find yourself consistently overwhelmed, please reach out to us early so we can discuss strategies for managing the workload effectively. Last but not least, please don't take STAT 133 lightly. If you feel that you cannot commit to attending all lectures and labs, please consider dropping the course and enrolling in a future semester when you can give it your full attention.

<br>

__I am a Concurrent Enrollment student. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?__ <br>
Concurrent Enrollment students will only be allowed to enroll if (a) there is space in the course and all UC Berkeley students who want to take the course have had a chance to enroll, meaning there should be no waitlist, and (b) we have determined that you have remained engaged with all the learning activities since the beginning of instruction. This includes, but is not limited to: attending lectures and labs, participating in discussions, completing assignments on time, and overall demonstrating a commitment to learning the material.

Keep in mind that the approval process for concurrent enrollment students takes place between the 2nd and 3rd week of instruction, and it is a somewhat slow 2-step process, which takes some days, and it involves not only my intervention but also the participation of one of the advisors in the Dept. of Statistics.

<br>

__I am a grad student officially enrolled. Do you have a grading structure for grad students?__ <br>
This semester we don't have a special grading structure for graduate students. All students will be evaluated with the same criteria. See the course syllabus for more information about the grading structure.

<br>

__What if I join the class late?__ <br>
If you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at bCourses to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you're up to date with things. Please keep in mind that we will not be providing late or make-up submissions for any missed assignments.

I do not recommend joining the class after two weeks into the semester, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take STAT 133.

<br>

__Are time conflicts allowed?__ <br>
STAT 133 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.

<br>

__I would like to switch lab sections with other student. Is this possible?__ <br>
This is not possible. You should attend the lab section you are officially enrolled in. If you have a time conflict with your lab section, please drop the course and enroll in a different section that fits your schedule or wait until a future semester to take STAT 133.

<br>

__Is this course a good fit if I don't have any programming experience?__ <br>
Quick answer: yes. Because Stat 133 has no prerequisites, we actually expect that many of you come without any coding experience. It is nice to have some programming experience under your belt, which makes the learning curve less steep. Having said that, if this is your first time coding, you should expect to spend a great amount of time doing work outside class (and also deal with the inevitable frustration that comes when learning any language).

<br>

__What if I don't have any data analysis experience?__ <br>
No problem. Because STAT 133 has no prerequisites, we actually expect that most of you come without any data analysis experience. In this course you will be working with a variety of fairly simple real data sets, as well as with simulated data.

<br>
 
__What if I've already taken several programming courses?__ <br>
You may find some parts of this course somewhat slow (and boring?) in terms of basics concepts such as data types, data structures, conditionals, loops, and functions. Unless STAT 133 is a required course for your major/minor (or you are eager to learn about R), please consider taking more advanced courses if what you are interested in is algorithms, computational statistics, databases, machine learning and statistical learning.

<br>
 
__Is this course a good fit if I don't intend to major in Statistics?__ <br>
STAT 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Major. The way I've been teaching this course is having Statistics majors as my target audience. However, much of the content should be helpful for any student who has to analyze data, or for those majors with some sort of data-analysis concentration.

<br>
 
__Is this course a good fit to become a data scientist?__ <br>
Becoming a data scientist is not a (one-semester) sprint. It is a (years-long) marathon. Like any other profession, it takes many years of learning, practice, practice, practice, and then some practice, to become a proficient data scientist/analyst. This course can be very useful, and we are confident it will help you to build a good foundation in your DS career.

<br>

__What if I don't want to be a data scientist?__ <br>
That's perfect too. You don't need to be a data scientist aspirant to take this course. Whether your plans are to become a consultant, life scientist, social scientist, journalist, or get some analytic skills, this course should be a good choice.

<br>
 
__Why is R (and not python) the main computational tool used in Stat 133?__ <br>
Historically, STAT 133 has always been taught with R, and this semester is no exception. Personally, I believe that both R and python are great tools, and it is a good idea that you learn both of them (especially if you are interested in Data Science, analytics, etc). STAT 133 gives you the opportunity to learn a fair amount of R. Quoting [Hadley Wickham](https://posit.co/blog/r-vs-python-what-s-the-best-for-language-for-data-science/):

> "Generally, there are a lot of people who talk about R versus Python like it’s a war that either R or Python is going to win. I think that is not helpful because it is not actually a battle. These things exist independently and are both awesome in different ways".

On a side note, [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka), one of the creators of R, obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley (in the Dept. of Statistics), so it is no coincidence that we are heavily influenced by R.

__Are we going to learn about machine learning methods?__ <br>
The Statistics department offers a dedicated course on this topic: STAT 154: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning. There is also CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning offered through Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). Similarly, DATA 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science covers several machine learning concepts.

<br> 

__Are we going to learn about databases?__ <br>
If you are interested in Databases you should consider CS 186: Introduction to Database Systems offered through Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).

<br>

__Are we going to learn about linear models?__ <br>
The Statistics department offers a dedicated course on this topic: STAT 151A: Linear Modeling, Theory and Applications.

<br>

__Are we going to learn about introductory statistics and/or probability?__ <br>
The Statistics department offers two core courses on these topics: STAT 134: Concepts of Probability, and STAT 135: Concepts of Statistics.  

<br>

__Can we work in groups?__ <br>
Yes, absolutely. We strongly encourage you to not work alone. Well, let me rephrase that. You should try to first work on your own (trial and error). Take notes of the things you don't understand. Then get with other people and discuss ideas, share tips (but not the entire solution).

<br>

__What if I don't agree with all the course policies?__ <br>
If there is one or more policies you don't agree with, then please reconsider your enrollment in the course. I am assuming that all students completely agree with the course policies described in the Syllabus.

<br>

__Can I ask you to write me a Letter of Recommendation (LoR)?__ <br>
Please take a look at this document before asking me to write you a letter of recommendation: <a href="https://github.com/gastonstat/letter-of-rec" target="_blank">https://github.com/gastonstat/letter-of-rec</a>. 

<br>

__I invited you to join my network in LinkedIn. Why haven't you accepted my invitation?__ <br>
First: Don't take it personal. It's not you, it's me. Second: if you really want that I become part of your network, why don't you talk to me in person? We can meet in Office Hours, or you can also schedule a meeting at a different time. Let me know you better than just as a distant contact in a social media networking site.
