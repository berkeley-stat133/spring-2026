## Agenda

- Using the Terminal and basic Unix commands
    + `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`
- Review: `qmd` files with [code chunks]{.bold-hilit}
    + R as a calculator
- QuartoPub
    + Sign up
- 1st Quarto Publication
- Problem Set 1


## Folder `stat133/`

Somewhere in your computer (e.g. Desktop, Documents) you should have the following folders and files:

\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
```{.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
  stat133/
    labs/
        lab1/
          lab1-first-last.qmd
          lab1-first-last.html
```
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
:::
::::

\

Let's determine the following file paths to `stat133/`

1) [absolute]{.mdlit} path to `stat133/`
2) [relative]{.hilit} path (from home directory) to `stat133/`

## Reminder: Special Symbols

\

| Symbol | Meaning                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| `/`    | root directory (1st slash)          |
| `A/B`  | A contains B (intermediate slash)   |
| `~`    | home directory (i.e. `/home/user/`) |
| `.`    | current directory                   |
| `..`   | parent directory                    |

## 

For example, assume I have the following file structure---starting at the root directory `/`

\

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .fragment width="55%"}
```{.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
  /
    Users/
      gaston/
        Documents/
          stat133/
            labs/
              lab1/
```
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="40%"}
Note:

My home directory is `/Users/gaston` which can be abbreviated as `~`
:::
::::

\


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .fragment width="60%"}
[Absolute paths:]{.mdlit}

- `/Users/gaston/Documents/stat133`
- `~/Documents/stat133`
:::

::: {.column .fragment width="40%"}
[Relative paths (from home):]{.hilit}

- `Documents/stat133`
- `./Documents/stat133`

# Terminal and Basic Unix commands

## Terminal in IDE

1) Launch your IDE (Positron or RStudio)

2) Locate the [Terminal]{.bold-hilit} tab (next to the _Console_ tab)

3) Click on the Terminal

- We use the **Terminal** to interact with the operating system.

- The way we carry out this interaction is by typing commands, e.g.
    - `pwd`: print working directory
    - `ls`: list files
    - `cd`: change directory
    - `mkdir`: make directory


##

In your Terminal, type the following commands:

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# print working directory (in theory your Home directory)
pwd
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# list files in current directory
ls
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# change directory to the parent dir of stat133/
# in my case it would be Documents (yours may vary)
cd Documents
```


## 

Assuming you are in the parent directory of `stat133/`

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# list contents
ls
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# change directory to your stat133 folder, and list contents
cd stat133
ls
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# change directory to labs folder, and list contents
cd labs
ls
```


## 

Assuming you are in your `labs/` folder

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# create a new folder lab2
mkdir lab2
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# change directory to lab2
cd lab2
```

\

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# create an empty qmd file "demo-pub1.qmd"
# (to be used for your first Quarto demo publication)
touch demo-pub1.qmd
```


# Quarto Files with Code Chunks

## Quarto Markdown (`qmd`) files

- YAML header (i.e. front matter)
- Narrative using markdown elements, e.g.
    + Sections, subsections, etc
    + Itemized lists (bullets)
    + Tables
    + Images
    + Hyperlinks
    + _ETC_
- [What about code?]{.bold-hilit}


## Open your `demo-pub1.qmd` document {.smaller}

Make sure your `qmd` file has the following content (or something similar):

```{.markdown filename="demo-pub1.qmd" code-line-numbers="false"}
---
title: "Demo Publication 1"
author: "Your Name"
format: html
---

## Markdown Content

This is my first [Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com/) demo.

- Coffee
- Tea
- Soda

![R logo](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)
```


## Code Chunks (_aka_ code cells)

```{{r}}

```

\

A code chunk is defined by:

- 3 "opening" consecutive backticks
- immediately followed by curly braces
    + `r` inside curly braces (R code cell)
- 3 "closing" consecutive backticks
- You write R code inside a chunk


## R Code Chunks

```{{r}}
2 + 3
```

\

```{{r}}
name <- c("Leia", "Luke", "Han")
```

\

```{{r}}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)
```


## Keyboard shortcuts to insert a code cell

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Positron:]{.hilit}

::: {.nonincremental}
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + I`
- Windows: `Crtl + Shift + I`
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[RStudio:]{.mdlit}

::: {.nonincremental}
- Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`
- Windows: `Crtl + Alt + I`
:::
:::
::::

. . .

- Don't be a _code chunk miser_ (stingy)
- Avoid "monster" chunks with too many things in them
- Better to use simpler chunks
    - easier to understand
    - easier to inspect
    - easier to debug


## Your Turn

Insert multiple code chunks in your `qmd` file to compute the following:

- Arithmetic operations
- Vectors using functions:
    - `c()`
    - `seq()`
    - `rep()`
- Vectorized operations: `sqrt()`, `log()`
- Summary functions: `sum()`, `mean()`, `min()`, `max()`

. . .

## Publishing Steps

Assume I have a file called `demo-pub1.qmd` opened in Positron. To publish my `qmd` file to my QuartoPub account I follow these steps:

1) Go to the __Terminal__ tab.
    + Make sure your working directory contains the qmd file.
2) Type command: `quarto publish demo-pub1.qmd`
3) Choose provider [Quarto Pub]{.bold-hilit} and press return (enter)
4) Publish with default account (linked to my email address)
5) Optionally: I can change the name of the document
6) Press return (enter)

. . .

Once published, there will be an associated link (URL), something like:
<https://username.quarto.pub/demo-pub-1>


## Submission to bCourses

Submit the URL (link) of your published document to the corresponding assignment in bCourses.

See [Assignments tab > Quarto Publications > Pub1]{.bold-hilit}
