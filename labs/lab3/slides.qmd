# Lab 3 - QuartoPub

## Folder `stat133/`

By now, your `stat133` folder should look like this:

```{.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
  stat133/
    labs/
        lab1/
        lab2/
    psets/
        pset1/
```


## Terminal in IDE

1) Launch your IDE (Positron or RStudio)

2) Launch your [Terminal]{.bold-hilit} (next to the _Console_ tab)

3) `cd` to your `stat133/labs/` folder

4) create a folder for this lab: `mkdir lab3`

5) `cd` to `lab3`

. . .

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# create an empty qmd file "demo-pub2.qmd"
# (to be used for your 2nd Quarto demo publication)
touch demo-pub2.qmd
```


## Open your `demo-pub2.qmd` document {.smaller}

Make sure your `qmd` file has the following content (or something similar):

# Quarto Pub

## Publishing Steps

Assume I have a file called `demo-pub2.qmd` opened in Positron. To publish my `qmd` file to my QuartoPub account I follow these steps:

1) Go to the __Terminal__ tab.
    + Make sure your working directory contains the qmd file.
2) Type command: `quarto publish demo-pub2.qmd`
3) Choose provider [Quarto Pub]{.bold-hilit} and press return (enter)
4) Publish with default account (linked to my email address)
5) Optionally: you can change the name of the document
6) Press return (enter)

. . .

Once published, there will be an associated link (URL), something like:
<https://username.quarto.pub/demo-pub-2>


## Submission to bCourses

Submit the URL (link) of your published document to the corresponding assignment in bCourses.

See [Assignments tab > Quarto Publications > Pub2]{.bold-hilit}


# Problem Set 2

## Pset 2

Available in bCourses:

See [Assignments tab > Problem Sets > PS2]{.bold-hilit}

You'll find 2 files:

- `ps2.html`: instructions

- `ps2.qmd`: template file to write your answers

. . .

In case of trouble: Go to Files tab, folder `problem-sets`, folder `ps2`, and download the `qmd` file.

Sometimes Safari blocks or denies you access. If this is the case you may want to use another browser (e.g. Chrome).


## Pset 2 Submission

- Submit your `qmd` and `html` files to bCourses.
- Use assignment problem set __ps2__
- Submission deadline: Wednesday 2/11 by 6PM.
