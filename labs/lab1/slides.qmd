## {.nostretch}

![](images/positron.png){width="85%" fig-align="center"}

Demo:

- Open Positron

- Understanding workspace

- Quadrants or panes


## Explorer (Positron) {.nostretch}

Let's focus on the __Explorer__ tab

![](images/positron-explorer.png){width="60%"}

## Explorer (Positron) {.nostretch}

Open your folder `stat133`

![](images/positron-folder.png){width="55%"}


## Explorer tab

- Let's focus on the __Explorer__ tab

- Use it to find your folder `stat133`

- Click on `stat133` (i.e. move inside this folder)

- Click on folder icon to create a `labs` folder

- Click on `labs` (i.e. move inside this folder)

- Inside `labs`, create a folder `lab1`


## First contact with Quarto File

- Open a Quarto file (i.e. Quarto document)

- Understanding anatomy of basic quarto file

    + YAML header
    + Narrative elements
    + Code chunks
    
- Edit YAML header:

    + `title: "Lab 1"`
    + `author: "First Last"`


## Rendering a `.qmd` file

- Click the [__Preview__]{.hilit} button. In RStudio is the __Render__ button.

- Save file in your `lab1` folder.

- Output file is an HTML document (assuming `format: html`)

- BTW: most assignments will require submission of their `.qmd` and `.html` files.


## Editing a `.qmd` file

Edit the content of your `.qmd` file to include the following content:

- Major(s) and, if applicable, minor.
- Hometown.
- Favorite song in the last 3 months.
- Insert a table (e.g. 3x3 table).
- Insert an image.
- Include a quote.

. . .

Render your quarto file again.


## Submission to bCourses

Submit both your `.qmd` and `.html` files to bCourses under the [lab1]{.hilit} assignment.

\

This is a "dummy" assignment: won't be part of your grade; we just want to make sure everyone knows how and where to submit `.qmd` and `.html` files.


## So far ...

::: {.nonincremental}
- Software Installed

- Directory, subdirectories, and files: 

```
  stat133/
    labs/
        lab1/
          lab1-first-last.qmd
          lab1-first-last.html
```

- Lab1 `.qmd` and `.html` files submitted to bCourses
:::


# Terminology

## 

### File

A named container that stores data---such as text, images, or programs---on a computer disk. 

The file name usually ends in an extension (`.txt`, `.png`, `.qmd`) that indicates the format.

\

### Directory (or Folder)

A named container that stores a set of files or other folders. 

We'll write directories by appending a slash at the end: e.g., `Documents/`, `stat133/`, `lab1/`


## In case of trouble

If you experienced any issues today, for example:

::: {.nonincremental}
- installing software
- rendering `.qmd` file
- submission to bCourses
- got lost along the discussion
:::

then please come to office hours!
