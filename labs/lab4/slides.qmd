## Agenda

-   Review: Basics of functions, if-else statements, for loops
-   Quarto Slides
    -   How can we make slides?
    -   Create your first slides
-   3rd Quarto Publication
-   Problem Set 3

## Review: Basics of Functions

::: nonincremental
-   Functions are defined using the `function()` command
-   Functions can take arguments (inputs) and return values (outputs)
-   Example:

``` r
add <- function(x, y) {
  sum <- x + y
  return(sum)
}
result <- add(3, 5)
# Output: 8
```
:::

## Review: If Else Statements

::: nonincremental
-   Used for conditional execution of code blocks
-   Syntax:

``` r
if (condition) {
  # code to execute if condition is TRUE
} else {
  # code to execute if condition is FALSE
}
```
:::

## Review: Example of If Else

::: nonincremental
``` r
light <- "green"

if (light == "green") {
  saber <- "Jedi"
} else {
  saber <- "Sith"
}

saber
```
:::

## Review: For Loops

::: nonincremental
-   Used to iterate over a sequence (like a vector or list)
-   Syntax:

``` r
for (variable in sequence) {
  # code to execute for each element in sequence
}
```
:::

## Example of For Loop

``` r
sum_vector <- function(vec) {
  total <- 0
  for (num in vec) {
    total <- total + num
  }
  return(total)
}
sum_vector(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 15
```

# Quarto Slides

## What can we do with slides?

As with our .qmd documents from last labs:

-   Text
-   Code chunks
-   Figures

We use Quarto for slides in STAT 133!

## Also:
-   In-line code
-   Code folding
-   Slide backgrounds and gradients
-   Bulleted lists and incremental bullets

### And much more!
[Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/)


## YAML Heading of a Slide Document
If QuartoPub not working, embed-resources to true to make sure all resources are included in the published document.

``` {.markdown filename="demo-pub2.qmd" code-line-numbers="false"}
---
title: "Demo Publication 3"
subtitle: "First Contact with Quarto Slides"
author: "Your Name"
format: 
  revealjs:
    embed-resources: true
---
```

## Formatting Slides
::: nonincremental
-   Quarto allows you to create slides using markdown syntax
-   Use `#` or `##` to separate slides
-   Example:

``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
# Slide 1 - Main Heading
Content of the slide goes here.

## Slide 2 - Smaller Heading
More content here.

### Slide 2 - Sub-subheading
```

:::

# Slide 1 - Main Heading

## Slide 2 - Smaller Heading

### Slide 2 - Sub-subheading




## Adding code

Code is added the same way as in regular `qmd` files, using code chunks.
\
``` r
# Example code chunk
x <- 10
y <- 20
sum <- x + y
```
\
But we can also do a lot more with code chunks in slides, such as...

## Echo True
By default, code chunks in slides will show the code but not the output. You can control this behavior using the `echo` option.

![](images/echotrue.png)

``` {r}
#| echo: true
# This code will be shown in the slide
x <- 10
y <- 20
sum <- x + y
```

## In-line code
You can also include in-line code using backticks: \
![](images/inline.png)
\

Talk to a partner: what would these lines output?

## In-line code
This code outputs: \
\
The sum of `x` and `y` is `x + y`. \
The sum of `x` and `y` is `r x + y`.
\
\
**Useful for:** \
- showing code without running it \
- showing formulas or calculations without needing a full code chunk

## Code Folding
You can fold code chunks to hide them by default and allow the audience to expand them if they want to see the code.

In YAML header:

``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
---
title: "Demo Publication 3"
subtitle: "First Contact with Quarto Slides"
author: "Your Name"
format: 
  revealjs:
    code-fold: true
    embed-resources: true
---
```

## Code Folding
In each code block that you want to fold:

![](images/code_fold.png){width=50px}

``` {r}
#| code-fold: true
# This code will be hidden by default
x <- 10
y <- 20
sum <- x + y
```


# Backgrounds
Another formatting option is to add backgrounds to your slides. You can use either a single color or a gradient.

# Adding Slide Backgrounds - Single Color

![](images/aquamarine.png)

## Adding Slide Backgrounds - Gradient 

![](images/gradient.png)


## Transitions by Slide
You can specify the transition and/or transition-speed for an individual slide:

``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
## Slide Title {transition="fade" transition-speed="fast"}
```
\

You can also specify separate in and out transitions, for example:
``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
## Slide Title {transition="fade-in slide-out"}
```

# Incremental Bullets {.smaller}
Last week: used `:::` to create columns. This week: use `:::` to create incremental bullets.
``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
::: {.incremental}
-   First bullet
-   Second bullet
-   Third bullet
:::
```

## Incremental Bullets
-   First bullet
-   Second bullet
-   Third bullet

These are helpful to reveal information step by step, keeping the attention on the current point being discussed.


# Quarto Pub

## Requirements: {.smaller}

:::{.nonincremental}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

Your slides must contain:

-   Title slide

-   At least one figure (web image or a local image)

-   Slide backgrounds (color and gradient)

-   At least one incremental feature

-   Use in-line code and code folding features

-   A function that decides the college of the student depending on its mascot (Bear = UC Berkeley, Tree = Stanford) using an if-else statement

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

![Stanford Tree](images/tree.png){width=200px fig-align="right"} \
![Cal Bear](images/bear.png){width=200px fig-align="right"}

:::
:::
<!-- end columns -->


:::



## Like last week: Folder `stat133/`

``` {.markdown code-line-numbers="false"}
  stat133/
    labs/
        lab1/
        lab2/
        lab3/
    psets/
        pset1/
        pset2/
```

## Terminal in IDE

1)  Launch your IDE (Positron or RStudio)

2)  Launch your [Terminal]{.bold-hilit} (next to the *Console* tab)

3)  `cd` to your `stat133/labs/` folder

4)  create a folder for this lab: `mkdir lab4`

5)  `cd` to `lab4`

. . .

``` {.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
# create an empty qmd file "demo-pub3.qmd"
# (to be used for your 2nd Quarto demo publication)
touch demo-pub3.qmd
```

## Publishing Steps

Assume I have a file called `demo-pub3.qmd` opened in Positron. To publish my `qmd` file to my QuartoPub account I follow these steps:

1)  Go to the **Terminal** tab.
    -   Make sure your working directory contains the qmd file.
2)  Type command: `quarto publish demo-pub3.qmd`
3)  Choose provider [Quarto Pub]{.bold-hilit} and press return (enter)
4)  Publish with default account (linked to my email address)
5)  Optionally: you can change the name of the document
6)  Press return (enter)

. . .

Once published, there will be an associated link (URL), something like: <https://username.quarto.pub/demo-pub-3>

## Submission to bCourses

Submit the URL (link) of your published document to the corresponding assignment in bCourses.

See [Assignments tab \> Quarto Publications \> Pub3]{.bold-hilit}

# Problem Set 3

## Pset 3

Available in bCourses:

See [Assignments tab \> Problem Sets \> PS3]{.bold-hilit}

You'll find 2 files:

-   `ps3.html`: instructions

-   `ps3.qmd`: template file to write your answers

. . .

In case of trouble: Go to Files tab, folder `problem-sets`, folder `ps3`, and download the `qmd` file.

Sometimes Safari blocks or denies you access. If this is the case you may want to use another browser (e.g. Chrome).

## Pset 3 Submission

-   Submit your `qmd` and `html` files to bCourses.
-   Use assignment problem set **ps3**
-   Graded credit / no-credit
-   Credit for evidence of earnest engagement (just don't submit a blank or empty template file)
