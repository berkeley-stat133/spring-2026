## Why EV Adoption Matters {background-color="#E8F3FF"}
California’s Clean Transportation Transition

Transportation is California’s largest emissions source

EV adoption supports:

- Reduced greenhouse gas emissions

- Improved air quality

- Energy independence

## State investments focus on:

- Charging infrastructure

- Technology innovation

- Consumer accessibility

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ev_sales <- read_csv("data/ev-sales-cleaned.csv")

head(ev_sales)
```

## Key Statistics: EV Adoption in California

We summarize EV adoption using county-level and vehicle-model data.

## Using dplyr tools, 
- Which CA county has the most EV sales in 2023?

```{r}
county_max_sales <- ev_sales |>
  group_by(county) |>
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_sales)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

- Which CA county has the least EV sales in 2023?

```{r}
county_min_sales <- ev_sales |>
  group_by(county) |>
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales)) |>
  arrange(total_sales) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

## Using dplyr tools,

- What model of EV is the most popular in CA in 2023?

```{r}
popular_model <- ev_sales |>
  group_by(model) |>
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_sales)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

- What model of EV is the least popular in CA in 2023?

```{r}
least_popular_model <- ev_sales |>
  group_by(model) |>
  summarise(total_sales = sum(sales)) |>
  arrange(total_sales) |>
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

## Statistics

- The county with the most EVs is `r county_max_sales`
- The county with the least EVs is `r county_min_sales`
- The most popular model is `r popular_model`
- The least popular model is `r least_popular_model`

## Key Takeaways {background-color="#F4FFF0"}

:::{.incremental}

- EV adoption continues to grow statewide

- Adoption is concentrated in specific counties

- A small number of vehicle models dominate sales

- Infrastructure investment remains critical for equitable adoption
