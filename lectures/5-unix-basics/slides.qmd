## Yesterday's Lab

-   Basic Unix commands
-   Opened QuartoPub account
-   Installed Quarto
-   Published a basic qmd file
-   Started PS1 (available on bCourses)


## Review of Quarto Commands

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
quarto render demo.qmd
```

. . .

\

```{.markdown filename="Terminal" code-line-numbers="false"}
quarto preview demo.qmd

# GUIs and CLIs

## GUI {.nostretch}

Windows and Mac use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for you to interact with 
the Operating System.

## About GUIs

- Easy to learn
- Rely on visual displays
- Can be extremely useful
- Have improved the friendliness and usability of computers
- Excellent for:
    + Photo editing
    + Document Layout
    + Browsing the web
    + Graphic design
    + Watching movies
    + Playing Games

### Instead of a GUI, you can use a Command-Line Interface (CLI)


## CLIs

- CLI: Command Line Interface
- The command-line is a text-based interface
- Instead of using a GUI we can use a CLI
- By typing commands we perform tasks on the computer

## About the Kernel

- The Kernel is the core of the operating system in Unix
- It takes care of allocating time and memory to programs
- It does very fundamental root level management


## About the Shell

- The Shell is the outer layer of the OS
- That's what we see when we open up a terminal window
- We are working in the Shell
- It interacts with the user and sends requests to the kernel
- The Kernel sends results back to the Shell


## CLI and Terminal

The command line is a text-based interface where you type commands and direct text-based input and output to the screen, to files, or to other programs.

The __Terminal__ (a.k.a. terminal emulator) is the program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.

Often, people blur the distinction between the Terminal and the Shell.
